# Osnova Overview

I am building a user application called Osnova that will serve as the basis for many distributed applications. Distributed application development is difficult and the ecosystem is very fractured. By creating a framework and marketplace where various frontend and backend components can be assembled and used, it will make it much easier for developers to create their end user applications.

The end result will be an experience very similar to the web browser of web 2.0 fame. By downloading this one application, users will have access to the full distributed application ecosystem. For developers it will enable them to create applications and launch them without having to deal with various app stores, etc.

## What is Osnova?

Osnova is a cross-platform application framework that enables users to run distributed applications in a browser-like environment. It provides:

- A unified platform for distributed application development
- Dynamic component loading and execution
- Cross-platform support (desktop and mobile)
- A familiar, browser-like user experience with tabs and windows
- Integration with distributed storage networks

## Key Features

### Browser-Like Experience
Osnova applications load into tabs and windows, enabling users to switch between different applications on the fly, just like a modern web browser.

### Component-Based Architecture
Applications are built from modular frontend and backend components that can be mixed, matched, and reused across different applications.

### Cross-Platform
Osnova runs on all major operating systems and architectures, providing installable binaries for:
- Windows, macOS, and Linux (desktop)
- Android and iOS (mobile)

### Distributed by Design
Components are versioned, immutable, and stored on permanent, content-addressed storage networks, ensuring applications can run reliably into the future.

## Operating Modes

### Stand-Alone Mode
By default, Osnova runs in stand-alone mode with all components executing locally on the device.

### Client-Server Mode
For resource-intensive operations or mobile usage, Osnova supports client-server mode where backend operations run on a user-configured server while the client handles UI rendering and interaction.

## Target Users

- **End Users**: Access distributed applications through a single, familiar interface
- **Developers**: Build and distribute applications without dealing with traditional app stores
- **Component Creators**: Develop reusable frontend and backend components for the Osnova ecosystem
