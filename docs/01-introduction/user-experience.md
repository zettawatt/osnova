# User Experience

The Osnova frontend that users will interact with needs to be sleek and modern in appearance. It should be simple to use and intuitive, following very similar conventions to what they expect from your standard web browser.

## Design Principles

### Familiar and Intuitive
Osnova follows web browser conventions that users already understand, minimizing the learning curve and making the platform immediately accessible.

### Sleek and Modern
The interface is designed to be visually appealing with clean lines, modern aesthetics, and thoughtful attention to detail.

### Cross-Platform Consistency
While respecting platform conventions, Osnova maintains a consistent experience across desktop and mobile devices.

## Application Navigation

### Tabs and Windows
Osnova applications load into tabs and windows, enabling users to:
- Switch between different applications on the fly
- Run multiple applications simultaneously
- Organize their workspace like a web browser

### App Launcher
Users can browse and launch applications through an intuitive launcher interface featuring:
- Grid-based icon layout
- Customizable icon placement
- Quick access to installed applications

## Platform-Specific Experiences

### Desktop
- Standard web browser-like interface
- Light/dark mode toggle in the top-right corner
- Automatic theme switching based on OS preferences
- Continuously scrolling application grid
- Click-and-drag icon reordering

### Mobile
- Clean interface optimized for touch interaction
- Bottom 5-icon menu for quick navigation
- Light/dark mode option in configuration
- Automatic theme switching based on OS preferences
- Multi-page grid for applications
- Long-press and drag for icon reordering

## First-Run Experience

### Onboarding Wizard
New users are guided through initial setup with a simple wizard that:
- Collects the user's display name
- Offers options to import an existing identity or create a new one
- For stand-alone or server installations, includes seed phrase generation or import
- Provides clear backup guidance for security credentials

### Identity Management
Users manage two identity artifacts:
- **4-word identity address**: For addressing and lookup
- **12-word seed phrase**: Master key for encryption and key derivation

Both import and restore flows are supported, making it easy to move between devices.

## Connection and Pairing

### Simple Server Pairing
Connecting a mobile device to an Osnova server is designed to be extremely easy:
- Scan a QR code on the server
- Or manually enter a 4-word identity address
- Automatic secure channel establishment
- Clear feedback on connection status

### Transparent Mode Switching
The system intelligently handles connection issues:
- Notifies users when a server is unreachable
- Offers retry options
- Suggests temporary stand-alone mode operation when appropriate

## Search Experience

### Context-Aware Search
The search bar adapts its presentation based on what users are looking for:
- **Applications**: App store-like display
- **Videos/Audio**: Streaming service-style layout
- **Images**: Tile-based image grid
- **Web pages**: Traditional search result format with context lines

This adaptive approach helps users find what they need quickly, regardless of content type.

## Performance

### Responsive and Fast
- Target: 2 seconds or less from app launch to first render
- Mobile clients remain responsive even when using remote backends
- Graceful handling of network latency

### Data Management
Users have full control over their data:
- Per-app configuration visibility
- Cache management and reset options
- Export and backup capabilities
- Clear warnings for destructive actions
