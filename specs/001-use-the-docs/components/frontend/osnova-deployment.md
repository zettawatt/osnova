# osnova-deployment component

It is written in Svelte as a static web app.
It is a single page application.

FIXME: create your best guess implementation for this component to fulfill the functions outlined in the osnova-bundler backend component. The idea here is it is an easy to use GUI to compile backend components with various targets, bundle frontend components into a single ZLIB tarball, create and manage component/app manifest files, and upload all of this stuff to the autonomi network. This should be a clean, one stop shop for all things osnova component and app development.
