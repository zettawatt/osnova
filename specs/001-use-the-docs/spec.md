# Feature Specification: Initialize Osnova feature spec from docs/spec.md

**Feature Branch**: `001-use-the-docs`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "use the @docs/spec.md as the initial specification"
**Source Document**: /home/system/osnova/docs/spec.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an end user, after installing Osnova I can browse and run distributed applications in a modern, browser‚Äëlike UI (tabs and windows) across platforms. I can optionally connect a mobile device to my home server to offload backend workloads while keeping the client responsive.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh installation with no server configured, **When** the user launches an Osnova app from the App Launcher, **Then** Osnova loads the app‚Äôs manifest, fetches and starts all listed components, and renders the UI in a new tab/window.
2. **Given** a server address is configured and pairing is completed, **When** the user uses Osnova on a mobile device, **Then** backend operations execute on the configured server while the mobile client remains responsive.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the configured server is unreachable or slow? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- How are multiple concurrent mobile clients handled by the server instance? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- What is the expected behavior when a manifest references a missing/invalid component version? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- How are encryption keys created, stored, rotated, and recovered? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a browser‚Äëlike UI with tabs and windows for switching between Osnova applications.
- **FR-002**: System MUST dynamically load components defined in an application manifest and run them to render the application UI.
- **FR-003**: System MUST run cross‚Äëplatform and provide installable binaries for all major OSes and architectures: Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, and various flavors of Linux.
- **FR-004**: System MUST support Stand‚Äëalone mode by default, with all components running locally on the device.
- **FR-005**: System MUST support Client‚ÄëServer mode where backend operations run on a user‚Äëconfigured server while the client interacts over the network.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow simple pairing of mobile devices to a user‚Äôs server (e.g., via QR code). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: pairing flow and security requirements]
- **FR-007**: System MUST isolate user data between clients and encrypt data at rest on both server and stand‚Äëalone devices. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: encryption standards and key management]
- **FR-008**: System MUST support multiple concurrent clients when running as a server.
- **FR-009**: System MUST include core applications by default: App Launcher, Crypto Wallet with Fiat Bridge, Search, File Manager, Configuration Manager. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: MVP scope for each]
- **FR-010**: Search MUST be context‚Äëaware, adjusting results format for apps, media, images, or web pages.
- **FR-011**: Components MUST communicate via generic protocols independent of Osnova to enable portability. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: protocols and interoperability constraints]
- **FR-012**: Each component version MUST be immutable and retrievable at a stable location. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: hosting/distribution mechanism]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Osnova Application**: A versioned manifest declaring frontend and backend components and required metadata.
- **Component (Frontend)**: Provides UI; interacts with backend components via generic protocols.
- **Component (Backend)**: Provides business logic; may interact with host resources, other components, or distributed networks.
- **Manifest**: Defines the list of components and configuration; versions are immutable and permanently retrievable.
- **Server Instance**: User‚Äëcontrolled host executing backend components for one or more clients.
- **Client Device**: User device (including mobile) that renders frontends and communicates with the server when configured.
