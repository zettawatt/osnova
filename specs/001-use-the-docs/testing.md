# Test strategy

FIXME: need a clean and thorough testing stragegy. For rust that means cargo fmt, cargo clippy, and cargo test all clean. For the JavaScript/TypeScript side we need some kind of test platform here, take your best guess on what this should be or describe what we have already in other parts of the documentation. For Android/iOS automated testing, this can be done post-MVP because the setup is just too complicated to deal with right now.
